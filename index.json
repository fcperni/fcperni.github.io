[{"categories":null,"content":"Data Visualization with Power BI (netcoreconf 2021) We live in the era of data. We are surrounded by data. There are tons of tools, methodologies, software, processes, etc. to extract, transform and load from just a couple or records to even tens of millions of records. But what about after all that? How can we make so much data usable? The key is to extract the inner insights existing on data, and the best way to detect, identify and transmit insights is visualization. We will learn how to uncover the underlying truth of our datasets creating simple but effective visualizations with Power BI, what are the most common mistakes and how to avoid them, and finally how to build a story to deliver the intrinsic message that lies beneath our data to our audience.\nDatasources, examples and slides Video ","date":"Nov 15, 2021","img":"","permalink":"/posts/data-visualization/","series":null,"tags":null,"title":"Data Visualization"},{"categories":null,"content":"This was my first utility written in Python, when I was learning the basics before going deep into the Databricks world.\nThis program will join all the csv files of a folder in a single one.\nDefault folder is \u0026ldquo;csv\u0026rdquo; and default output file is \u0026ldquo;joined.csv\u0026rdquo;.\nAvailable options:\n1 -h --help Display this help screen. 2 -f --folder Sets the folder that contains the files. 3 -o --output Sets the name of the output file.
