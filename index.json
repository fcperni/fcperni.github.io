[{"categories":["Pet Projects"],"content":"Creating a blog with Hugo  and hosting it in GitHub Pages  is easy. I am not going to explain it because you have this wonderful post by @panicoenlabox , who explains it perfectly and it is the one that I followed.\nIt contains information about creating a site with Hugo, deploying it to GitHub pages via GitHub Actions and even setting your custom domain for the site. I would just highlight that I used a different template, in my case, Hugo Bootstrap Theme (you can see a real life example of this template here ).\nBesides creating the blog, my goal was to connect it to Google Analytics  in order to collect user information. I am really concerned about data security and data anonymization, but I do understand the value of knowing who visits your sites, from where are they connected, which pages receive visits or don\u0026rsquo;t and many other important KPIs.\nFor connecting the blog with Google Analytics, I simply created an account in their site and set up a property.\nCopy the Tracking Id, as you will need it to set it in the config.toml of your Hugo Site.\nIf everything works properly, you can go to the Real Time dashboard in Google Analytics and see one connection.\nIf you have an Ad Blocker, like UBlock, it will block the Google Analytics script. Disable it for your site or use another browser. I wasted an incredible amount of time on this.  Google Analytics collects, analyzes and visually represents inside their web this information, but the ultimate goal was to extract the logs recorded in Google Analytics and instead of using the already provided visualizations by Google, create our owns with Tableau. In this example we will use Tableau Desktop.\nWe open it and select the appropriate connection\nA browser tab will open and we need to select the Google account that we used for setting Google Analytics and give permissions to Tableau. After we have set up everything, we need to go back to Tableau Desktop.\nIn the Datasource tab, we will need to select the Google Analytics account, property and view (in case that we had more than one). Also, we need to select a Date Range.\nThe final step will be to select Dimensions and Measures. There a severals pre-defined groups that will provide you with a collections of fields, which you con add, remove or combine with others. For a first contact, we can select the Site Usage group.\nAfter following all these steps, is up to us to create our Visualizations, Dashboards and or Stories with Tableau to analyze properly our site data.\nYou can find the source code of this blog in this GitHub repository .\n","date":"Nov 23, 2021","img":"","permalink":"/posts/hugo-blog-with-ga/","series":null,"tags":["Hugo","Blog","Data","GitHub","Google Analytics","Tableau"],"title":"Create a Hugo Blog and connect it with Google Analytics"},{"categories":["Conferences"],"content":"There are many tools for creating data visualizations, but one of the most common used and powerful is Power BI.\nIn the previous edition we learned how to create effective visualizations in Power BI to display insights existing on data, showing information extracted from logs recorded in App Insights of an API hosted in Azure.\nIn this edition we will learn what is the structure of a good story, the steps to create it and how to build a compelling story using Power BI to highlight the information that lies underneath our data.\nThis session was imparted in netcoreconf 2021-2\nDatasources, examples and slides Video ","date":"Nov 18, 2021","img":"","permalink":"/posts/data-storytelling/","series":null,"tags":["Data","Power BI","Storytelling"],"title":"Data Storytelling with Power BI"},{"categories":["Conferences"],"content":"We live in the era of data.
